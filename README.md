# AppIntent
This is an app that shows how to make app Intents, i.e for one to open links, email, location, dial pad , from the in app view to the basic android apps mentioned.
this are Implicit Intents(Implicit intents do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app to handle it.),
hence any button that is pressed upon will let the native android up complete the task outside of your mobile application with already predefined inputs that you can change in your code base.

The immages below show you a glimpse of what to expect.
